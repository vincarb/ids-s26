## Homework 1 
**Quarto and Git setup**:
Quarto and Git are two important tools for data science: Quarto for 
communicating results (reports/websites/books) and Git/GitHub for 
version control and collaboration. This homework is about getting
familiar with them through the following tasks. 

**Your goal**: produce a short, beginner-friendly *step-by-step manual* 
for yourself (and future students) that documents what you did, what 
went wrong, and how you fixed it. Please use the 
[`templates/hw.qmd`](https://github.com/statds/ids-s26/blob/main/templates/hw.qmd) as your starting point. Use the command line 
interface.

**Work in your GitHub Classroom repository** (the private repo created 
for you when you accept the assignment link). Use the command line 
interface unless a step explicitly requires a 
browser (e.g., adding an SSH key).

**Submission (What should be included in your repo)**

+ `hw.qmd` (your completed manual)
+ `hw.html` (rendered from `hw.qmd`)
+ `hw.pdf`

**Tasks**

a. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment and clone your repo (SSH).

  + Accept the assignment using the GitHub Classroom link provided on HuskyCT.
  + In a terminal, verify Git is installed:
    + `git --version`
  + Set your Git identity (do this once per computer):
    + `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
    + `git config --global user.email "XXX@uconn.edu"`  (use the 
         email tied to your GitHub account if different).

b. Set up SSH authentication between your computer and GitHub. There 
are [`online tutorials`](https://docs.github.com/en/
authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) with more details.

  + Check whether you already have an SSH key:
    +`ls -al ~/.ssh`
  + If you do not see something like `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`,
  create a new key:
    + `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
    + Press Enter to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
    + Choose a passphrase or press Enter for none
  + Start the SSH agent and add your key:
    + `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
    + `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
  + Copy your public key and add it to GitHub:
    + `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
    + In your browser: GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH 
    key
  + Test the connection:
    + `ssh -T git@github.com`
    + You should see a message that you have successfully 
         authenticated.
  + Now clone your GitHub Classroom repo (SSH) and enter it:
    + `git clone git@github.com:<ORG>/<REPO>.git`
    + `cd <REPO>`

c. Set up the homework file in your repo.

  + Download/copy the template into your Classroom repo as `hw.qmd`.
  + Make an initial commit:
    + `git status`
    + `git add hw.qmd`
    + `git commit -m "Start HW1"`
    + `git push`

d. Install Quarto and verify it works. Follow the official installation 
instructions at <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/> for your 
operating system. Then verify:
    + `quarto --version`
    + `quarto check`

In `hw.qmd`, record exactly what you installed (version +  method), and 
any issues you hit (PATH problems are common) and how you fixed them.

e. Pick an editor/tool and reproduce the "line plot on polar axis" 
example.  
  + Choose one tool (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter, Positron, Emacs) and 
  follow the Quarto documentation to reproduce the example plot.
  + Minimum requirement: include the plot in your `hw.qmd` using a 
  Python code cell that produces a polar line plot with Matplotlib. For 
  example:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={"projection": "polar"})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rmax(2.0)
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Render the homework into a HTML. Print the HTML file to a pdf file and put the file into a release in your GitHub repo.
