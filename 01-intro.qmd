## What Is Data Science?

Data science is a multifaceted field, often conceptualized as resting
on three fundamental pillars: mathematics/statistics, computer
science, and domain-specific knowledge. This framework helps to
underscore the interdisciplinary nature of data science, where
expertise in one area is often complemented by foundational knowledge
in the others.


A compelling definition was offered by Prof. Bin Yu in her 2014
Presidential Address to the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
She defines
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{Data Science} =
\mbox{S}\mbox{D}\mbox{C}^3,
\end{equation*}
where

+ 'S' represents Statistics, signifying the crucial role of
statistical methods in understanding and interpreting data;
+ 'D' stands for domain or science knowledge, indicating the
importance of specialized expertise in a particular field of study;
+ the three 'C's denote computing, collaboration/teamwork, and
communication to outsiders.

Computing underscores the need for proficiency in programming and
algorithmic thinking, collaboration/teamwork reflects the inherently
collaborative nature of data science projects, often requiring teams
with diverse skill sets, and communication to outsiders emphasizes the
importance of translating complex data insights into understandable
and actionable information for non-experts.


This definition neatly captures the essence of data science,
emphasizing a balance between technical skills, teamwork, and the
ability to communicate effectively.

## Computing Environment

All setups are operating system dependent. As soon as possible, stay away from
Windows. Otherwise, good luck (you will need it).

### Operating System
Your computer has an operating system (OS), which is responsible for
managing the software packages on your computer. Each operating system
has its own package management system. For example:


- **Linux:** Linux distributions have a variety of package managers
    depending on the distribution. For instance, Ubuntu uses APT
    (Advanced Package Tool), Fedora uses DNF (Dandified Yum), and Arch
    Linux uses Pacman. These package managers are integral to the
    Linux experience, allowing users to install, update, and manage
    software packages easily from repositories.


- **macOS:** macOS uses Homebrew as its primary package
    manager. Homebrew simplifies the installation of software and
    tools that aren't included in the standard macOS installation,
    using simple commands in the terminal.


- **Windows:** Windows users often rely on the Microsoft Store for
    apps and software. For more developer-focused package management,
    tools like Chocolatey and Windows Package Manager (Winget) are
    used. Additionally, recent versions of Windows have introduced the
    Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows Windows users to run
    a Linux environment directly on Windows, unifying Windows and
    Linux applications and tools. This is particularly useful for
    developers and data scientists who need to run Linux-specific
    software or scripts. It saves a lot of trouble Windows users used
    to have that users previously faced before WSL was introduced.

Understanding the package management system of your operating system
is crucial for effectively managing and installing software,
especially for data science tools and applications.

### File System

A file system is a fundamental aspect of a computer's operating
system, responsible for managing how data is stored and retrieved on a
storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB flash
drive. Essentially, it provides a way for the OS and users to organize
and keep track of files. Different operating systems typically use
different file systems. For instance, NTFS and FAT32 are common in
Windows, APFS and HFS+ in macOS, and Ext4 in many Linux
distributions. Each file system has its own set of rules for
controlling the allocation of space on the drive and the naming,
storage, and access of files, which impacts performance, security, and
compatibility. Understanding file systems is crucial for tasks such as
data recovery, disk partitioning, and managing file permissions,
making it an important concept for anyone working with computers,
especially in data science and IT fields.


Navigating through folders in the command line, especially in
Unix-like environments such as Linux or macOS, and Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL), is an essential skill for effective file
management. The command cd (change directory) is central to this
process. To move into a specific directory, you use `cd` followed by the
directory name, like `cd Documents`. To go up one level in the directory
hierarchy, you use `cd ..`. To return to the home directory, simply
typing `cd` or `cd ~` will suffice. The `ls` command lists all files and
folders in the current directory, providing a clear view of your
options for navigation. Mastering these commands, along with others
like `pwd` (print working directory), which displays your current
directory, equips you with the basics of moving around the file system
in the command line, an indispensable skill for a wide range of
computing tasks in Unix-like systems.


### Command Line Interface

On Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal.

On Windows, several options can be considered.

+ Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL): <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>
+ Cygwin (with X): <https://x.cygwin.com>
+ Git Bash: <https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash>

To jump-start, here is a tutorial:
[Ubuntu Linux for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners).

At least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across
directories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful.

Here are several commonly used shell commands:

+ `cd`: change directory; `..` means parent directory.
+ `pwd`: present working directory.
+ `ls`: list the content of a folder; `-l` long version;
   `-a` show hidden files; `-t` ordered by modification time.
+ `mkdir`: create a new directory.
+ `cp`: copy file/folder from a source to a target.
+ `mv`: move file/folder from a source to a target.
+ `rm`: remove a file a folder.


### Python

Set up Python on your computer:

- Python 3.
- Python package manager __miniconda__ or __pip__.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Jupyter Notebook; RStudio; VS Code; Emacs; etc.)

I will be using VS Code in class.

Readability is important!
Check your Python coding style against the recommended styles:
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>. A good place to start is the Section on
"Code Lay-out".
